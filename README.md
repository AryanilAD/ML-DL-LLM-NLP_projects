The primary objective of this project is to harness the power of data analysis to gain insights into the underlying factors that influence the development and prognosis of leukaemia. To achieve this, I have meticulously collected, preprocessed, and analysed three datasets: actual_data, training_data, and testing_data.The actual_data contains vital information about the cancer type, serving as the target variable. It indicates whether a patient has AML or ALL. On the other hand, the training_data and testing_data consist of gene expression data. By merging these datasets, I created a unified dataset that will be used for training and evaluating predictive models.
